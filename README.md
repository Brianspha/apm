# apm (Arweave Package Manager)

This is POC project (I decided to not continue with the project due to limitations presented with searching for packages but i will be continuing in the future) I was going for a fully arweave package manager which is extremely hard i got stuck with uncompressing the buffer received from arweave when a user runs ` `apm install [packagename]` `

## Project setup

``` 
npm install
```

## Running Localy

Make sure you ` `cd ./cli` ` before you run any commands 
``
node .\apm.js help

For allowed commands

Or just run the .exe file from the folder or your platforms executable then run using the follwing command
``
 .\apm-win.exe help
``
